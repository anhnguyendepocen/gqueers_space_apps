## About Page

Project G.I.D.E.O.N. (General Impact Detection using Emitted Light, Onset of Covid-19, and Nitrogen Dioxide) makes use of historical GDP, emitted light (proxy variable for income), onset of covid-19 growth, and environmental factors (nitrogen dioxide content in a country) to predict GDP values sooner. It scores countries' GDP forecasted change as light, moderate or heavy/critical.
