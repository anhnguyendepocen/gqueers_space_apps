General Impact Detection using Emitted Light, Onset of Covid-19, and Nitrogen Dioxide
The odds of the pandemic to the economy are against us. 
Let's beat the odds with satellite data using GIDEON's nowcast tool. 

## About Page

Project G.I.D.E.O.N. (General Impact Detection using Emitted Light, Onset of Covid-19, and Nitrogen Dioxide) makes use of historical quarterly GDP, emitted light (proxy variable for income), onset of covid-19 growth, and environmental factors (nitrogen dioxide content in a country) to predict GDP values sooner. 

It scores countries' GDP forecasted change as light, moderate or heavy/critical to help policy makers made decisions. The "traffic light" system produced by our solution can inform policy makers about certain economic decisions. If the dip in the GDP is caused by mobility, for example, easing lockdown may be essential to jumpstart the economic activity of the country and have the GDP recovery. 

Nowcasting GDP means the countries no longer have to wait until the official GDP quarterly data has been posted before they take action.
