		<div class="w3-padding">
			<p>Emergencies justify temporary and limited restrictions on human rights. Public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic have the potential to weaken societies, political systems and economies simultaneously. Hence, reasonable limitations on human rights protections are necessary to respond to crises immediately and effectively.</p>
			<p>An emergency situation, however, is not a blank check to disregard human rights obligations. On 16 March 2020, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights issued its call for all States to "avoid overreach of security measures in their response to the coronavirus outbreak and reminded them that emergency powers should not be Used to quash dissent."</p>
			<p>Notably, emergencies provide opportunities for populist leaders to erode democracy and human rights. In weak democracies, populations will be more susceptible to populist authoritarian appeals.</p>
			<h3 class="w3-large din-bold">PHILIPPINES</h3>
			<p>The quarantine measures implemented in the Philippines have restricted the rights of affected populations. A 6-month state of calamity, proposals to take over private utilities, and increased surveillance of social media posts critical of government, imposition of curfews, and shoot-to-kill orders for those who violate quarantine measures all demonstrate the willingness of duty-bearers to disproportionately expand state authority. The coronavirus pandemic threatens to further erode public confidence in human rights and democratic values through panic, anxiety and fear.</p>
			<h3 class="w3-large din-bold">I-ACT's RESPONSE</h3>
			<p>I-ACT emphasizes the importance of gathering data on human rights knowledge, attitudes and behaviors as a precondition to crafting effective targeted messaging to prompt public support and engagement in support of human rights. Understanding how different segments of the population contemplate and perform human rights is at the core of I-ACT's strategy.</p>
			<p>The current emergency measures in place offer I-ACT with a Unique opportunity to interrogate how different groups view and evaluate restrictions on human rights vis-Ã vis crises situations as it unfolds. The unprecedented increase in the demand for public goods and services also provides a chance for I-ACT to understand rightsseeking and -claiming behavior, and if and why these are articulated as such. The lACT paradigm of Diagnose-Prototype-lnstitutionalize is especially suited for the current crisis situation as this design thinking approach allows for responsiveness without sacrificing data-driven strategies.</p>
			<h3 class="w3-large din-bold">THIS DASHBOARD</h3>
			<p><b>I-ACT COVID INSIGHTS</b> is an interactive data navigation tool designed to help the I-ACT team gather and assimilate big data underpinning I-ACT initiative, from social media listening to focused group discussions to inbound call center to chatbots. As the project progresses, the data gathered and analyzed by the I-ACT teams will be featured here for further insights. This dashboard is built and managed by CirroLytix Research Services.</p>
